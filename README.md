# Unexciting Godot Space Shooter

Loosely following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNhMW555KBpk8iyIKCIf3arzlK6_H8NLx) because 99% of Godot tutorials I've found about how to make games in Godot cover the easy/fun part: making the actual gameplay segment.
Sure, you can set up a [platformer in 20 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thgdTkxeNJY&pp=ygUeZ29kb3QgcGxhdGZvcm1lciBpbiAyMCBzZWNvbmRz), but getting from a playable platformer to a releasable game is 95% of the work.
I'm interested in learning how to, say, transition from menus to gameplay and back, handle save files, leaderboards and other persistent data, restarting from game over, etc. The nitty gritty details the tutorials don't touch.

I *loooooooove* Godot so far and I'm super excited to start making stuff with it, but I'm going to have to work on my foundations a bit first. This is just a toy project exploring Godot idioms and nitty gritty details. Ideally it'll be tiny, but still technically releasable.
In fact, I think I'm going to release it on itch.io when it's done. That's a very simple milestone where I can tie this off and call it done. Then I'll pat myself on the back, maybe do one more project like this, then start prototyping fun ideas.
